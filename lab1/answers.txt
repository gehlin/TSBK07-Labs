    uniform specifies information about a whole primitive, which
    contains multiple vertices.

2.2 Image positions calculated from model coordinates, and
    all "out"-variables.

2.3 It passes a uniform matrix to the vertex shader.

3.1 50fps

4.1 No, not really.
4.2 See 2.1.
4.3 Gouraud shading! Flat or Phong shading can
    be used otherwise.

5.1 Took a long time hard-coding
    the vertices and colors.
5.2 Rotation?? Or defining normals.

6.1 We want to know in which direction the surface faces.
6.2 Just set the color. Nothing new.
6.3 Yes.
6.4 glBindbuffer ??, glBufferData buffers the specified data.
